    Description:
    The water level of a river is measured (in meters) and recorded every hour. An alarm is triggered if any of the following
    two conditions are met:
    1. The water level has risen by more than 0.2 meters during the last hour, and the resulting water level is higher
    than 1.5 meters.
    2. The water level is above 2.0 meters.
    The water level measurements are stored in a list called water_levels. Your task is to write a function that returns
    the index of the first alarm. If no alarm is triggered, the function should return -1. All inequalities are strict (< is strict
    whereas ≤ is not); for example, a water level of exactly 2.0 meters is not enough to trigger an alarm.

    Input:  list called water_levels.
    
    Output: the index of the first alarm. If no alarm is triggered, the function should return -1.
